#  What is Jolly Roger? 

The Jolly Roger is the name given to a pirate flag flown to identify a ship as being engaged in piracy. The flag is usually black, and often has a white skull and crossbones on it.

The first mention of the Jolly Roger comes from 1718, when British pirates flying a red flag with a yellow skeleton on it were captured by the French. The term "Jolly Roger" was likely coined soon afterwards, and it has been used ever since to describe pirate flags.

While there are many different designs for pirate flags, the skull and crossbones is the most commonly used symbol. This is because it is both easy to make and is associated with death, which was seen as a desirable outcome for pirates.

The Jolly Roger is not only a flag, but also a name given to the pirates who flew it. The most famous group of pirates to use the Jolly Roger was undoubtedly the crew of Bartholomew Roberts, who flew an extremely elaborate design that featured multiple skulls and crossed bones.
