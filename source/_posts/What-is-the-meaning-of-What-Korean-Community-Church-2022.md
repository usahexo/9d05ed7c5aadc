What Korean Community Church 2022 (WKCC) was founded on October 10th, 2022 by Pastor Kim and his wife. They had been attending another church but were not satisfied with the level of spiritual growth they were experiencing. Out of their desire to find a church that would help them grow in their faith, they started WKCC with just twelve people in attendance.

Since then, WKCC has grown exponentially and now has over two thousand members! The church is focused on helping people grow in their faith as well as providing support for those who are struggling. Pastor Kim’s sermons are based on the Bible and he often shares personal stories to help people connect with the teachings.
