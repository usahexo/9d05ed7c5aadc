#  Celebrate Chinese New Year with a game of chance!

This year, Chinese New Year begins on February 16th and lasts for fifteen days. It is a time of celebration marked by parades, firecrackers, and family gatherings. Food is an important part of the holiday, with dishes like dumplings and noodles typically served.

But what about games? If you're looking for some fun ways to celebrate Chinese New Year, why not try a game of chance? Here are a few popular options:

* Mahjong: This tile-based game is believed to have originated in China over 2,000 years ago. The object of the game is to remove all of the tiles from the board by matching them up with similar tiles.

* Goose: Also known as 'shuttlecock', this game is centuries old and popular in countries like China, India, and Malaysia. Two players face off against each other, trying to keep a feathered shuttlecock in the air using a wooden or plastic racquet.

* Fu Lu Shou: This board game was invented during the Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD) and is still popular today. The goal is to be the first player to move all of their pieces from their Home Row to the opponent's Home Row.

* Paper folding: Originating in China, this art form has been around for over 1,000 years. Popular designs include animals, flowers, and characters from Chinese mythology.
