#  How much can you win on Si Xiang Scratch?

Si Xiang Scratch is a Chinese lottery game that offers players the chance to win large jackpots. The game is played using a ball machine that randomly selects 12 numbers from 1 to 80. Players must match at least three of the numbers drawn to win a prize.

The maximum jackpot is 3,000,000 yuan (approximately $462,000), but the odds of winning are quite low. In fact, the chances of winning any prize are just 1 in 9. So, how much can you realistically expect to win on Si Xiang Scratch?

If you want to play for the jackpot, your best bet is to bet on all 12 numbers. This gives you a 1 in 8,000 chance of winning the top prize. However, you will only receive a payout if you match all 12 numbers. So, your expected return on investment (ROI) is negative 8,000%.

If you're happy with a smaller prize, you can still have some fun playing Si Xiang Scratch. For example, if you bet on just six numbers, your odds of winning are 1 in 120 and your expected ROI is positive 10%. So, for every 100 yuan you bet, you can expect to win an average of 10 yuan back.
