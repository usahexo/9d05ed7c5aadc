#  Basque basketball powerhouse Baskonia suffers heavy loss in Euroleague betting

Basque basketball powerhouse Baskonia suffered a heavy loss in Euroleague betting this week, as they were easily dispatched by CSKA Moscow 96-68. This was a particularly unforeseen upset, as Baskonia was considered the underdog in the matchup.

The loss dropped Baskonia down to third place in their group, with just two games remaining. If they're to have any chance of making it through to the next round of the tournament, they'll need to win both of those games and hope other results go their way.

This disappointing result comes after an impressive start to the season for Baskonia. They opened up their Euroleague campaign by winning their first six games, including a victory over CSKA Moscow. However, they've since gone on to lose four of their last seven matches.

One of the main problems for Baskonia has been their lack of scoring power. They're currently ranked second-last in the league for points per game, averaging just 73.3 points per match. This is well below the likes of CSKA Moscow and Real Madrid, who are both averaging more than 87 points per game.

Baskonia will need to find a way to improve their offence if they're to make any further progress in this year's Euroleague tournament.

#  Sharps punish Baskonia for lackluster performance; -0.25 yields healthy return

* Spanish League (Liga ACB) * Basketball

The Sharps were out in full force on Friday, punishing Baskonia for a lackluster performance and securing a healthy return in the process.

Baskonia entered the game as a 1.5-point home favorite but failed to cover the spread, losing 92-86 to FC Barcelona. The market responded accordingly, with -0.25 yielding a healthy return on investment.

Sharps are defined as bettors who make wagers with the intention of winning money, as opposed to gamblers who simply hope for a pleasant surprise. They generally focus on well-informed betting strategies and enjoy substantial success in doing so.

Friday's matchup provided an excellent opportunity for them to make some money, as Baskonia was coming off two consecutive losses and had not looked particularly sharp in either contest. Barcelona, meanwhile, was enjoying a seven-game winning streak and appeared to be hitting its stride.

The game played out largely as expected, with Barcelona leading for most of the contest before sealing the victory in the final minutes. Baskonia never really threatened to pull off the upset and ended up losing by six points. This outcome was disappointing for their fans but resulted in a nice payday for the Sharps.

#  Sports betting proves unkind to Spanish side; Baskonia falls to Schalke 04

In the first leg of the Round of 16 in the European Basketball Champions League, defending champion Real Madrid was upset by German side Schalke 04. The Germans had not beaten Madrid on their home floor in 25 years, but they managed to do so this time by a score of 78-72. Schalke now holds a 2-point advantage as the teams head to Germany for the second leg.

Things did not go much better for another Spanish representative, Baskonia. They were handily defeated by German squad Schalke 04 by a score of 104-77. This result gives Schalke a convincing 27-point lead as they head back to Spain for the second leg. With these two setbacks, it would appear that Spanish teams are in for a disappointing finish in this year’s European Basketball Champions League.

#  Boosted by ex-NBA player Shane Larkin, Baskonia off to strong start in Eurocup

Ciudad Deportiva de San Sebastián, Basque Country, Spain--Boosted by the play of ex-NBA player Shane Larkin, Baskonia has gotten off to a strong start in the Eurocup.

Baskonia is one of sixteen teams competing in this year's Eurocup, the second-highest level of professional basketball in Europe behind the Euroleague. The team is coached by Veljko Mrsic, who was hired before the start of this season to replace former head coach Zinedine Zidane.

The club's roster includes several players with experience in the NBA, including Shane Larkin and Johannes Voigtmann. Larkin, who is playing in his first season with Baskonia, is coming off a successful career with the Dallas Mavericks and New York Knicks. Voigtmann, who played for FC Bayern Munich last season, spent two years with the Atlanta Hawks.

The team got off to a strong start in the Eurocup, winning their first three games. They are currently in first place in their group, ahead of teams such as Maccabi Tel Aviv and Anadolu Efes Istanbul.

While it's still early in the season, Baskonia looks like a serious contender for the title this year. With players like Larkin and Voigtmann leading the way, they have what it takes to make a deep run in the tournament.
