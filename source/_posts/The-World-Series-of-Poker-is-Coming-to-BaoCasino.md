According to the agreement, BaoCasino will become the exclusive sponsor and operator of all WSOP tournaments, starting in 2020. This includes both live and online tournaments.

Bao Casino CEO Tony Hsieh said that his company was excited to be partnering with the WSOP. "This is a hugely iconic event and we are proud to be associated with it," he said. "We are committed to providing our players with the best possible gaming experience, and this partnership will help us achieve that goal."

WSOP Executive Director Ty Stewart added that BaoCasino was a perfect fit for the WSOP. "They share our commitment to delivering a premium gaming experience, and we believe they have the potential to take our tournaments to even greater heights," he said.

The WSOP has always been known for its high- stakes events, and under BaoCasino's stewardship, these will only get bigger and better. Players can look forward to more lucrative prize pools, as well as world-class tournament facilities and support staff.
