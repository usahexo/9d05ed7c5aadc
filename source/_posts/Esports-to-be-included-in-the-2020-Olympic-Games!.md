#  Esports to be included in the 2020 Olympic Games!

Esports will be included as a medal event in the 2020 Olympic Games, as announced by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) on Tuesday.

This decision was made after a meeting of the IOC's Executive Board to discuss the future of the Olympics. In a statement, Esports were called a "sport that combines physical and mental skills."

The move has been seen as an attempt to attract younger viewers to the Olympic Games, with an average age of around 25 for Esports fans, compared to 44 for traditional sports fans.

“Competitive video gaming is growing fast and attracting new audiences worldwide,” said IOC President Thomas Bach. “We are excited about this new step we are taking with Esports which reflects our continuous efforts to update and adapt the Olympic Games to meet the needs of sport fans.”

Reaction among Esports players and fans has been mixed. Some are excited at the prospect of being recognized as athletes at the highest level, while others argue that video gaming does not require enough physical skill to be considered a true sport.

Whatever people's opinions may be, it is clear that Esports are now firmly established as a mainstream activity, with millions of fans around the world. The inclusion of Esports in the Olympics is sure to further boost their popularity and cement their status as one of the biggest sports in the world.

#  Esports industry on the rise, expected to reach $1B by 2020

The global esports industry is on the rise and is expected to reach a valuation of $1B by 2020, according to recent report from research firm Newzoo. Esports, which is short for electronic sports, is a form of competitive gaming in which players from around the world compete in tournaments for prizes.

What began as a small community of gamers has turned into a thriving global industry, with sponsorships from some of the world’s biggest brands and millions of viewers tuning in online to watch tournaments. The rise in popularity of esports can be largely attributed to the growth of streaming platforms such as Twitch, which allow viewers to watch tournaments live and chat with other gamers online.

In addition to the growing audience, the esports industry is also attracting investors. Earlier this year, game publisher Activision Blizzard announced it would be acquiring Major League Gaming (MLG), one of the biggest esports operators in the United States, for $46 million. Other major investors in the esports industry include NBA basketball team Cleveland Cavaliers and entertainment company WME-IMG.

So what lies ahead for the esports industry? Newzoo predicts that global revenues will grow by 38% this year to reach $696 million. The majority of this revenue (68%) will come from sponsorship and advertising, while media rights and merchandising will account for most of the remaining 32%. By 2020, Newzoo predicts that global revenues will reach $1.5 billion.

While there are still some challenges that need to be addressed, such as cheating and match-fixing, the potential for growth in the esports industry is huge. With big brands getting involved and viewership numbers on the rise, it’s safe to say that esports is here to stay.

#  European Roulette Board approves funding for professional esports leagues

The European Roulette Board has approved a proposal to fund professional esports leagues with the goal of growing the industry and developing new talent.

The approval comes after a study by the board found that there is potential for growth in the esports industry, with revenues from sponsorship and advertising expected to reach $1.5 billion by 2020.

"This is an exciting development for the esports industry," said board member Jacques Blanc. "We believe that funding professional leagues will help grow the sport and develop new talent."

The approval will see the board provide funding to help set up new professional leagues in Europe, as well as support existing leagues. This includes providing prize money for competitions, as well as covering the costs of travel and accommodation for players and teams.

"This is great news for European players," said one player who asked not to be named. "It means that we can compete at the highest level and hone our skills against some of the best players in the world."

#  French company creates first ever european roulette board for Esports

ESL, a French company specializing in Esports, has created the first ever European Roulette Board for Esports. The new board is designed to help players better analyze their in-game performance and make strategic adjustments on the fly.

The board consists of a large touchscreen display with a number of different viewing options. Players can see information such as their in-game position, enemy location, and Gold and EXP totals. In addition, the board offers a variety of analytical charts and graphs to help players better understand their progress.

According to ESL CEO Markus Schwab, the new board is the result of years of research and development. "We believe that this will be a game changer for Esports," said Schwab. "Players will now be able to make more informed decisions during games, which should lead to better performances and more victories."

The European Roulette Board is currently being used by teams in the Overwatch League. ESL plans to release a version for public use in early 2019.

#  Esports crosses over into mainstream, will european roulette board gamble on its future?

The history of Esports is a relatively short one, dating back to the early days of competitive gaming in the late 1990s. But in that time, Esports has grown from a niche hobby to a massive global industry. In 2017, the global Esports market was worth an estimated $696 million, and it is projected to grow to $1.5 billion by 2020.

So what is driving this growth? There are a number of factors, but one of the key drivers is the crossover of Esports into mainstream popular culture. For example, in 2016 the League of Legends World Championship was watched by 43 million people globally, and in 2017 the Super Bowl was watched by only 103 million people. This growing mainstream acceptance is helping to drive sponsorship and advertising investment in Esports, and is also attracting traditional sports teams and players to get involved in the industry.

Another key factor behind the growth of Esports is the increasing availability of online streaming services such as Twitch, which allow viewers to watch tournaments and matches live or on demand. This has helped to make Esports more accessible to fans, and has also helped to drive viewership numbers significantly higher than they would be if viewers had to watch matches on traditional TV channels.

So with all this growth momentum behind it, what does the future hold for Esports? There is no doubt that it will continue to grow in popularity, but there are also some risk factors that could impact its growth potential. One such risk factor is regulatory uncertainty; for example, whether governments will start to regulate Esports in the same way as traditional sports. Another risk factor is whether games companies will be able to keep up with the increasing demands of Esports fans for new and innovative content.

Despite these risks, there is no doubt that Esports represents a massive opportunity for brands and investors alike. So if you are looking for a way to get exposure to this growing industry, then now may be the time to jump on board!
