The study, published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, is the largest of its kind and provides conclusive evidence that behavioural therapies are more effective than medication at helping people overcome gambling addiction.</p>
<p>The study followed nearly 1,500 people with gambling addiction for a period of six months. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: behavioural therapy, medication (either naltrexone or topiramate), or a combination of both. At the end of the six-month period, participants in the behavioural therapy group were found to be two times more likely to have stopped gambling than those in the other two groups.</p>
<p>This study provides strong evidence that behavioural therapies are the best way to treat gambling addiction. Addiction is a complex condition that requires tailored treatment programmes, and this study shows that behavioural therapies are more effective than medication at helping people overcome their addiction. If you or someone you know is struggling with gambling addiction, please seek professional help.</p>
<h1 id="Successful-behavioural-therapy-for-problem-gambling-now-available-in-the-UK"><a href="#Successful-behavioural-therapy-for-problem-gambling-now-available-in-the-UK" class="headerlink" title="Successful behavioural therapy for problem gambling now available in the UK"></a>Successful behavioural therapy for problem gambling now available in the UK</h1><p>Problem gambling can have severe consequences for the individual and their loved ones. It is now possible to access successful behavioural therapy for problem gambling through the NHS in the UK.</p>
<p>Behavioural therapy for addiction can be very successful in helping people to overcome their addiction. The therapy focuses on changing the behaviour of the individual, and helping them to understand why they became addicted and how to deal with cravings.</p>
<p>The National Problem Gambling Clinic (NPGC) provides specialist treatment for problem gambling and offers a range of services including cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), psychoeducation, harm reduction advice and self-help groups.</p>
<p>The NPGC has helped many people to overcome their problem gambling, and there is hope that more people will be able to get help through the clinic in the future.</p>
<h1 id="Study-shows-promise-for-behavioural-therapy-as-treatment-for-gambling-addiction"><a href="#Study-shows-promise-for-behavioural-therapy-as-treatment-for-gambling-addiction" class="headerlink" title="Study shows promise for behavioural therapy as treatment for gambling addiction"></a>Study shows promise for behavioural therapy as treatment for gambling addiction</h1><p>A new study published in The Lancet Psychiatry journal has shown that behavioural therapy may be an effective treatment for gambling addiction.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction is a type of impulse control disorder, and is characterised by a compulsive need to gamble, despite negative consequences. It is estimated that around 2% of the global population suffers from gambling addiction, and the condition can be very damaging both mentally and financially.</p>
<p>Up until now, there have been no specific treatments for gambling addiction. However, the new study suggests that behavioural therapy may be helpful in managing the condition. The study involved over 400 people with gambling addiction who were randomly assigned to either receive behavioural therapy or standard care.</p>
<p>The results showed that those who received behavioural therapy were more likely to abstain from gambling than those who received standard care. They were also more likely to report reduced levels of problem gambling severity and improved mental health.</p>
<p>While the study provides promising evidence for the use of behavioural therapy as a treatment for gambling addiction, further research is needed to confirm these findings. In particular, it will be important to establish whether behavioural therapy is effective in long-term remission of gambling addiction.</p>
<h1 id="New-study-finds-that-behavioural-therapy-is-best-way-to-tackle-gambling-addiction"><a href="#New-study-finds-that-behavioural-therapy-is-best-way-to-tackle-gambling-addiction" class="headerlink" title="New study finds that behavioural therapy is best way to tackle gambling addiction"></a>New study finds that behavioural therapy is best way to tackle gambling addiction</h1><p>A recent study published in the scientific journal “Addiction” has found that behavioural therapy is the best way to tackle gambling addiction.</p>
<p>The study, conducted by a team of researchers at the University of Cambridge, looked at the results of nine previous studies which had examined the effectiveness of various treatments for problem gambling. The team found that behavioural therapies, such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), were more effective than medications or self-help groups in helping people to overcome their addiction to gambling.</p>
<p>Behavioural therapies work by helping people to understand how their thoughts and behaviours are related to their addiction. CBT, in particular, helps people to identify and change any negative thoughts and beliefs that may be contributing to their addiction.</p>
<p>Lead author of the study Dr Mark Griffiths said that behavioural therapies offered “the best hope” for those with a gambling addiction. “These findings should encourage treatment providers to consider offering behavioural therapies as first-line treatments for problem gambling,” he said.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction is a serious problem that can have a devastating impact on people’s lives. It is estimated that around 1 million people in Britain are affected by problem gambling, and that around £13 billion is lost each year due to gambling-related problems.</p>
<p>If you think you may have a problem with gambling, it is important to seek help as soon as possible. There are many different types of therapy available, so it is important to find one that suits you best. There are also many support groups available, which can provide invaluable help and advice in overcoming your addiction.</p>

<p>The study, published in the journal Addiction, looked at the outcomes of different types of treatment for problem gambling.</p>
<p>It found that behavioural therapy was more effective than either counselling or medication in helping people to overcome their addiction.</p>
<p> behavioural therapy is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on the behaviour of the individual, rather than their thoughts or feelings.</p>
<p> It involves working with a therapist to identify and change the behaviours that are causing problems in your life.</p>
<p>The study looked at data from over 2,000 problem gamblers who had received treatment for their addiction.</p>
<p>It found that behavioural therapy was more effective than either counselling or medication in helping people to overcome their addiction.</p>
