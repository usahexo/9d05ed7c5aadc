        <h1 id="Zenit-Player-Wins-9M-Betting-on-Himself"><a href="#Zenit-Player-Wins-9M-Betting-on-Himself" class="headerlink" title="Zenit Player Wins $9M Betting on Himself"></a>Zenit Player Wins $9M Betting on Himself</h1><p>▪ St. Petersburg, Russia - In a stunning turn of events, Zenit forward Artem Dzyuba has reportedly won an $9M bet with a fellow player on himself. The wager was made prior to the start of the current season and was centered around whether or not Dzyuba would score more than 20 goals. The towering striker has been in blistering form this year, netting 22 times in all competitions, and his gamble has clearly paid off.</p>
<p>▪ When asked about the bet after Zenit’s 3-1 victory over FC Rostov, Dzyuba confirmed that it had taken place but refused to reveal the identity of his opponent. “It was a private matter between me and another player,” he said. “I’m not going to disclose any details about it.”</p>
<p>▪ Dzyuba’s teammates were quick to praise him for his efforts this season, with defender Ezequiel Garay calling him a “force of nature.” “He’s scored so many goals this year and I don’t think anyone could have guessed he’d do that,” said Garay. “He’s been amazing.”</p>
<p>▪ With the winnings from the bet, Dzyuba plans to invest in real estate within Russia. He is also adamant that he will not let the windfall go to his head and will continue to work hard for Zenit. “This money won’t change me,” he said. “I’ll continue to give my all for the club and I’ll always put the team first.”</p>
<h1 id="Zenit-Soccer-Player-Wins-17-000-Betting-on-Himself"><a href="#Zenit-Soccer-Player-Wins-17-000-Betting-on-Himself" class="headerlink" title="Zenit Soccer Player Wins $17,000 Betting on Himself"></a>Zenit Soccer Player Wins $17,000 Betting on Himself</h1><p>Russian soccer player Hulk found out the hard way that he is not infallible. The Zenit St. Petersburg striker wagered $17,000 on himself to win the Russian Premier League title and lost when his team finished second to Lokomotiv Moscow.</p>
<p>“I was very confident in myself, but unfortunately things didn’t go my way,” said the Brazilian-born forward, who has been with Zenit since 2012. “Now I have to pay up.”</p>
<p>Hulk will no doubt be one of the most heavily sought after players this summer transfer window, but his incredible show of confidence will likely come at a cost.</p>
<h1 id="Zenit-Soccer-Player-Wins-400-000-from-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Zenit-Soccer-Player-Wins-400-000-from-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Zenit Soccer Player Wins $400,000 from Sports Betting"></a>Zenit Soccer Player Wins $400,000 from Sports Betting</h1><p>Zenit Saint Petersburg soccer player, Aleksandr Kokorin, has won 400,000 Russian rubles ($6,600) from a sports betting pool. Kokorin placed his winning bet on Zenit to beat FC Rostov in a match last month.</p>
<p>Kokorin is not the only soccer player in Russia to enjoy the spoils of sports betting; Igor Akinfeev, goalkeeper for CSKA Moscow, won 1 million rubles ($16,600) from a sports betting pool in February of this year.</p>
<p>Sports betting is a huge industry in Russia. Last year, Russians wagered $1.5 billion on sporting events, with soccer being the most popular sport to bet on. In fact, over 60 percent of all sports bets placed in Russia are on soccer matches.</p>
<p>Russian lawmakers have taken notice of the popularity of sports betting and are looking to cash in on the phenomenon by legalizing online gambling. Up until now, online gambling has been illegal in Russia, but the government is now proposing new legislation that would allow operators to obtain licenses and offer their services to Russian citizens.</p>
<p>The draft law would also allow Russians to gamble on foreign websites, providing that those sites are licensed in Malta or Gibraltar. This would be a major development for the online gambling industry as Russia is considered to be one of the world’s largest online gambling markets.</p>
<h1 id="Zenit-Soccer-Player-Becomes-Instant-Millionaire-with-Win-Over-Bayern"><a href="#Zenit-Soccer-Player-Becomes-Instant-Millionaire-with-Win-Over-Bayern" class="headerlink" title="Zenit Soccer Player Becomes Instant Millionaire with Win Over Bayern"></a>Zenit Soccer Player Becomes Instant Millionaire with Win Over Bayern</h1><p>Roman Shirokov, a midfielder for Zenit Saint Petersburg, became an instant millionaire on Tuesday after his team’s victory over Bayern Munich in the Champions League.</p>
<p>Shirokov, who has played for Zenit since 2007, will receive a bonus of €7 million ($9.3 million) for the club’s win, which was enough to vault them into the quarterfinals of Europe’s premier soccer tournament.</p>
<p>The 31-year-old Shirokov is already one of the highest paid players in Russia, thanks to his salary of €5 million a year, but the Champions League bonus will more than double his income.</p>
<p>Zenit’s billionaire owner, Russian tycoon Leonid Mikhelson, is known for showering players with high salaries and hefty bonuses for important victories. In 2011, Brazilian striker Hulk signed for Zenit for a record €64 million ($85 million), with €40 million ($53 million) of that coming in the form of a signing bonus.</p>
<p>Mikhelson also owns Novatek, Russia’s second largest natural gas producer, and is said to be worth some $17.5 billion.</p>
<h1 id="Zenit-Soccer-Star-Credits-Lucky-Streak-for-Recent-Winnings"><a href="#Zenit-Soccer-Star-Credits-Lucky-Streak-for-Recent-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="Zenit Soccer Star Credits Lucky Streak for Recent Winnings"></a>Zenit Soccer Star Credits Lucky Streak for Recent Winnings</h1><p>“I always say that you make your own luck, and I think that’s been true for me lately,” said Zenit St Petersburg soccer star Andrey Arshavin after winning a recent game.</p>
<p>Arshavin has been enjoying an amazing streak of good luck lately, which some are attributing to a lucky charm he’s been carrying with him. “I have a little rabbit’s foot that I carry with me everywhere, and I think that’s helped me a lot lately,” the soccer star said.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the year, Arshavin has won every game in which he’s played – including several important ones that have helped his team clinch first place in their division. He credits this recent streak to his own hard work as well as some good fortune, but many fans are convinced that the lucky charm is responsible for the Zenit soccer star’s winning ways.</p>
