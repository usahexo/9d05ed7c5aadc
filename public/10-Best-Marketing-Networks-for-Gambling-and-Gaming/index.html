In 2017, it was worth $51.96 billion and is estimated to grow to a staggering $81.52 billion by 2022, according to Statista. The industry is growing for a variety of reasons, including the legalization of gambling in new markets, the increasing number of millennials who are gambling, and the growth of online and mobile gaming.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to get into the gambling and gaming industry – or if you’re already in it and want to expand your reach – you need to be aware of the best marketing networks for this sector. Here are 10 of the best:</p>
<ol>
<li>Google AdWords</li>
</ol>
<p>Google AdWords is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising platform that lets you place ads on Google’s search engine results pages (SERPs) and millions of other websites across the web. AdWords is perfect for gambling and gaming companies because it allows you to target people based on their search queries. For example, you can target people who have searched for “online casinos” or “casino games” with your ads.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Facebook Ads</li>
</ol>
<p>Facebook Ads is another powerful PPC platform that allows you to target people based on their interests, demographics, and behaviors. You can use Facebook Ads to run targeted campaigns aimed at people who are interested in gambling and gaming brands and products. Facebook Ads is also great for retargeting – i.e., targeting people who have visited your website or clicked on your Facebook Ads in the past.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Bing Ads</li>
</ol>
<p>Bing Ads is Microsoft’s answer to Google AdWords, and it’s a great platform for targeting people who are searching for information about gambling and gaming products and brands online. Bing Ads offers many of the same features as AdWords, including keyword targeting and retargeting.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Twitter Advertising</li>
</ol>
<p>Twitter Advertising lets you place ads on Twitter that appear in users’ timelines or in other areas of the Twitter website such as the Discover tab. Like Facebook Ads, Twitter Advertising offers great targeting options that allow you to reach potential customers based on their interests, demographics, and behaviors. Additionally, Twitter Advertising offers unique features like promoted tweets and lead generation cards that can help you boost your marketing efforts for the gambling and gaming industry.</p>

But with so many networks to choose from, how do you know which one is right for you? Here are four things to look for when evaluating gambling&#x2F;gaming marketing networks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reputation</li>
</ol>
<p>The first thing you want to look at is the reputation of the network. How long has it been around? What are other people saying about it? Is it reliable and reputable?</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Size and Reach</li>
</ol>
<p>The second thing to look at is the size and reach of the network. How many members does it have? How wide is its reach? Is it able to target a global audience or just a specific region or country?</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Services and Features</li>
</ol>
<p>The third thing to look at is the services and features offered by the network. What types of marketing services does it provide? What types of tools and resources are available to help you promote your business? Is there a support team available if you need help with marketing or technical issues?</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Price</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, don’t forget to consider price. How much does it cost to join the network? What are the fees for using its services? Are there any discounts available for members who use more than one service?</p>

In this article, we will take a look at some of the pros and cons of using an affiliate marketing network for this purpose.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Increased Exposure to Potential Customers - One of the biggest benefits of using an affiliate marketing network for gambling or gaming is that it exposes your website or business to a larger audience of potential customers. By partnering with an established affiliate marketing network, you can reach out to a large number of people who are interested in gambling or gaming-related activities. This can help increase traffic and sales to your website or business.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Increased Revenue - Another benefit of using an affiliate marketing network for gambling or gaming is that it can help increase your revenue. By partnering with an established network, you can tap into their pool of active customers and earn a commission on any sales that you generate. This can help boost your income and bottom line profits.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Easier Marketing and Promotion - Another advantage of using an affiliate marketing network for gambling or gaming is that it makes marketing and promotion easier. The networks have established relationships with both consumers and merchants, so they can help promote your website or business to their audience members. This can help save you time and money when marketing your site.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Higher Costs - One disadvantage of using an affiliate marketing network for gambling or gaming is that it can be more expensive than working with individual affiliates. The networks typically charge a commission on sales, which can eat into your profits margins. Additionally, the networks may have higher overhead costs than working with individual affiliates, which can also increase your costs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Less Control Over Affiliates - Another disadvantage of using an affiliate marketing network for gambling or gaming is that you have less control over the affiliates that are associated with your site. The networks typically have pre-existing agreements with a large number of affiliates, so you may not be able to work with the specific affiliates that you want. This can limit your ability to target specific consumers or promote specific products or services.</p>
</li>
</ol>
