        <h1 id="Dean-Cain-Used-to-Be-a-Casino-Dealer-Here’s-Why-He-Removed-the-First-Cards-from-the-Deck"><a href="#Dean-Cain-Used-to-Be-a-Casino-Dealer-Here’s-Why-He-Removed-the-First-Cards-from-the-Deck" class="headerlink" title="Dean Cain Used to Be a Casino Dealer: Here’s Why He Removed the First Cards from the Deck"></a>Dean Cain Used to Be a Casino Dealer: Here’s Why He Removed the First Cards from the Deck</h1><p>Actor Dean Cain has been in the acting business for almost three decades. And, though some people might not know this about him, he started his career as a casino dealer. In fact, it was at a casino in Reno, Nevada that Cain stepped up to the table and first dealt cards to players.</p>
<p>There’s a good reason why Cain departed from the casino scene, though. He later recounted that he didn’t like how “the house always won.” This is likely one of the reasons why he transitioned into acting; to have more control over his own fate and create opportunities for himself where there may not be any others.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, though, Cain still brings his casino dealing experience to the table (no pun intended) in one very specific way: when he’s playing poker. He’s admitted in the past that he likes to take his time with each hand and really analyze what’s happening at the table. Considering how important patience is in poker, this may be one of the skills that he learned during his time as a dealer.</p>
<h1 id="What-Made-Dean-Cain-Remove-the-First-Cards-from-the-Deck-in-Blackjack"><a href="#What-Made-Dean-Cain-Remove-the-First-Cards-from-the-Deck-in-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="What Made Dean Cain Remove the First Cards from the Deck in Blackjack?"></a>What Made Dean Cain Remove the First Cards from the Deck in Blackjack?</h1><p>Player decisions are the main focus of blackjack, but what about the dealer? Does he or she have a choice in the matter? The answer is yes, but those choices can be limited. One such decision that a dealer has is how to start the hand. Do they deal one card to each player and then the next card to themselves, or do they deal two cards to each player and then one to themselves? In most cases, the dealer will deal two cards to each player and then one to themselves. But what about when the player has 21 points on their first two cards?</p>
<p>There are some dealers who will deal one card to each player and then the next card to themselves no matter what. This is called Early Hole Carding. There are also some dealers who will always deal two cards to each player and then one to themselves no matter what. This is called Late Hole Carding. Then there are some dealers who will mix it up, dealing one card to each player at some tables and two cards at others. Finally, there are some dealers who will always deal two cards to each player, no matter what the point total is.</p>
<p>The vast majority of dealers use Early Hole Carding, dealing one card to each player and then the next card to themselves. This allows them more control over when they get their hole card and how much information they can give away about their hand. When they deal two cards to each player as their first action, it makes it easier for players to determine when they should double down or hit against them.</p>
<p>But not all dealers use Early Hole Carding. Dean Cain, who was a blackjack dealer for many years before becoming an actor, always removed the first two cards from the deck prior to dealing any hands. This made it much harder for players at his table to determine when they should make certain plays against him. Since most dealers use Early Hole Carding, this gave Cain a bit of an advantage over his opponents.</p>
<h1 id="Why-Did-Dean-Cain-Start-Removing-the-First-Cards-from-the-Deck-in-Blackjack"><a href="#Why-Did-Dean-Cain-Start-Removing-the-First-Cards-from-the-Deck-in-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="Why Did Dean Cain Start Removing the First Cards from the Deck in Blackjack?"></a>Why Did Dean Cain Start Removing the First Cards from the Deck in Blackjack?</h1><p>There are all sorts of Blackjack strategies out there, and players constantly debate as to the best ways to play. One of the most debated topics is whether or not to remove the first card from the deck, and actor Dean Cain has caused a stir in the Blackjack community by advocating for doing just that.</p>
<p>At first glance, it might not seem like there is much of a difference between removing the first card from the deck and not removing it. But Dean Cain claims that removing the first card can give you an advantage over the house. Here’s why.</p>
<p>When you remove the first card from the deck, it changes the odds for all of the other cards in the deck. This is because when you remove the first card, there are now 51 cards left in the deck instead of 52. This means that there is now a higher chance that any particular card will be drawn next.</p>
<p>This may not seem like a big deal, but when you’re playing against the house, even a small advantage can be significant. In fact, if you can manage to remove just one or two cards from the deck each time you play, over time this can add up to a significant edge over the house.</p>
<p>So why does Dean Cain advocate for removing the first card from the deck? According to him, it’s all about giving yourself an edge over the house. And when it comes to Blackjack, every little bit helps.</p>

The purpose of this is to give themselves an advantage by knowing what the first card is. This can help them in making better decisions when it comes to betting.</p>
<p>There are many theories out there about why dealers might remove the first card from a deck but most of them boil down to a couple of reasons. One reason is that the dealer wants to protect themselves from getting a bad hand. Another reason is that they want to give themselves an edge when it comes to betting.</p>
<p>Some people think that dealers do this because they know that players are more likely to bet if they see a good card at the start of the hand. Others think that dealers do this in order to force players into making bad decisions.</p>
<p>There is no concrete evidence that dealers are actually removing cards from decks on purpose. However, many casino experts believe that it does happen occasionally. If you are playing at a casino, keep an eye on the dealer’s hands and see if they seem to be behaving in a suspicious manner.</p>

He has also starred in other TV series and films, including the lead role in the drama “Riptide”.</p>
<p>In his book “The Rules of Blackjack - An Insider’s Guide to Winning”, Cain discusses how he became a blackjack dealer and how this experience influenced his decision to remove the first cards from the deck.</p>
<p>Cain started dealing blackjack in 1976 when he was just 18 years old. His father had some connections in the casino industry and arranged a job for him as a dealer at a small casino near Lake Tahoe. This gave him the opportunity to learn about the game from the inside and to hone his skills as a player.</p>
<p>Over time, Cain developed into a very successful blackjack player. He says that one of the reasons for his success was that he always played by the rules - something that is not always possible when playing against experienced dealers who may try to take advantage of inexperienced players.</p>
<p>In 1990, Cain was working as a dealer at the MGM Grand casino in Las Vegas when he noticed that some of the other dealers were cheating by removing first cards from the deck. This gave them an unfair advantage over players, allowing them to make more money by knowing what cards were remaining in the deck.</p>
<p>Cain decided to take action and removed all of the first cards himself, thus eliminating their advantage. He then warned other dealers about what he had done so that they would not be able to cheat players in this way.</p>
<p>His actions made headlines across Las Vegas and he quickly became known as “the guy who took out first cards”. Some people praised him for standing up for fairness and honesty in gambling, while others criticized him for potentially ruining the game for everyone involved.</p>
<p>Regardless of what people thought about his actions, there is no doubt that Cain’s experience as a dealer gave him a unique insight into how blackjack works - an insight that helped him become a successful player. It also helped him make the decision to remove first cards from decks, which ultimately led to fairer play for all involved.</p>
